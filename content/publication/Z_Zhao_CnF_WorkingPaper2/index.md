abstract: Equivalence ratio (ϕ) oscillation is a critical element within the feedback loop of thermoacoustic instabilities in various propulsion and power systems. In this study, velocity-decoupled ϕ modulation methane/air flame system over modulation frequency from 0 up to 40 Hz was realized using a two-valve configuration coupling with a multiple physical quantities measurement encompassing ϕ (using broadband UV absorption spectroscopy), heat release (using high-speed flame CH* chemiluminescence), velocity (using hot wire anemometry) and pressure (using dynamic pressure sensor), and three parameters were considered including mean equivalence ratio (ϕ0), modulation amplitudes (ɛ), facilitating a systematic study of the flame transfer function (FTF) and flame dynamics to the corresponding perturbations. According to the results, when the system is subjected solely to ϕ modulation, ϕ0 exerts a more pronounced influence on the FTF of global CH* intensity (FCH*-global, can be divided into two parts, flame area, FA and intensity of CH*, FCH*-osc) than ɛ. While FA (FCH*-osc) shows a less significant impact on FCH*-global at the case of ϕ0=1.0 (1.2). Besides, the quasi-steady state assumption is invalidated after the frequency is higher than 2 Hz through the performance of the local CH* intensity. Furthermore, a theoretical method using FCH*-global and FA is used to calculate the FTF of heat release (FQ) and shows a good consistency with the experimental FQ comparing with the traditional method using the steady relationship between the CH* intensity and heat release. In summary, the equivalence ratio oscillation plays a vital role in thermoacoustic instability and need to be investigated through the velocity-decoupled ϕ modulation system.
