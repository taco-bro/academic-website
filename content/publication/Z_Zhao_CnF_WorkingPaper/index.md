abstract: Thermoacoustic instability is a prevalent and critical challenge in combustion systems, typically driven by either velocity perturbations or equivalence ratio (ϕ) oscillations. In this study, a single-valve modulation system was employed to systematically investigate the response of a CH₄/air swirl-stabilized premixed flame to ϕ oscillations under low turbulence intensity conditions. Synchronous, time-resolved measurements of ϕ, CH* chemiluminescence, velocity, and pressure were conducted to analyse the flame dynamics and construct transfer functions. With increasing modulation frequency, the contribution of convection-driven ϕ perturbations gradually diminished, while vortex-induced ϕ disturbances became more dominant—significantly altering the amplitude and phase of the chemiluminescence response. A multi-input single-output (MISO) transfer function framework was subsequently applied to decouple the respective transfer function of velocity and ϕ perturbations. For the case with mean equivalence ratio equal to 0.8, the flame exhibits a linear response when the ϕ fluctuation amplitude at the reference point is below 0.1, while larger perturbations lead to nonlinear effects. Finally, a linearized G-equation model, combined with convection–diffusion theory and experimentally measured flame angle variations, was used to derive the transfer functions of the heat release rate and its components. The results reveal the influence of dissipation effects on the frequency dependence of these transfer functions. This study provides both theoretical and experimental insights for the modeling and control of combustion instability induced by equivalence ratio fluctuations.
