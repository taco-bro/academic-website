## Overview

A systematic investigation is conducted on the flame response of a CH4/air swirl-stabilized premixed flame in response to equivalence ratio fluctuations. The study integrated multi-physics diagnostics to obtain transfer functions and delineate the linear-response regime and developed a linearized G-equation model that predicts heat-release transfer functions and decomposes contributions, including convectiveâ€“diffusive effects within the equivalence-ratio dynamics.

## Outcome
- Journal Article (Under review): [**Identification of the linear response regime in a lean premixed CH4/Air swirl flame forced by equivalence ratio oscillation**](/publication/Z_Zhao_CnF_WorkingPaper/)
