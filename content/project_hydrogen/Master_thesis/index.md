## Overview

A systematic investigation is conducted on the flame response of a laboratory-scale single-nozzle micro-mix burner. The study focuses particularly on the generation and transport of equivalence ratio fluctuations, as well as the flameâ€™s response to velocity and equivalence ratio perturbations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental measurements are combined to provide a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.

## Outcome
- Conference (Oral presentation): [**Flame transfer function of a single-nozzle micromix burner using jet-in-cross flow for pure hydrogen**](/publication/W_Liang_ASPACC2025Conference/): 
- Journal Article (Under review): [**The impact of non-stiff fuel injection on the acoustic response of a partially premixed pure hydrogen flame**](/publication/W_Liang_WorkingPaper/)
