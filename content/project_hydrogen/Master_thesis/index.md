A systematic investigation is conducted on the flame response of a laboratory-scale single-nozzle micro-mix burner. The study focuses particularly on the generation and transport of equivalence ratio fluctuations, as well as the flameâ€™s response to velocity and equivalence ratio perturbations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental measurements are combined to provide a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.
