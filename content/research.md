# Thermoacoustic Instabilities in Clean Combustion Systems

## Introduction:
Hydrogen, recognized as a promising alternative decarbonized fuel, has received considerable attention. However, the shift from natural gas to hydrogen in modern well-established gas turbines, which rely on lean premixed combustion to reduce NOx emissions, increases the risk of flashback, potentially causing catastrophic damage to the structure. This necessitates alternative strategies to enable safe and stable hydrogen combustion. The micro-mix concept has recently gained renewed attention for the burning of pure hydrogen. Instead of achieving a fully premixed fuel-air mixture far upstream of the flame, this strategy involves injecting fuel near the exit of the burner, allowing for rapid mixing with the incoming air flow. However, this leads to insufficient mixing and is thus often referred to as a partially premixed (or technically premixed) system since the non-uniformity of the equivalence ratio is still present at the flame. Understanding how flames respond under these conditions is critical for the development of next-generation, carbon-free gas turbines. In particular, fluctuations in the equivalence ratio -- closely linked to velocity fluctuations and strongly influenced by burner design -- play a central role in flame dynamics. Studying this coupling is therefore essential to improving the stability and safety of hydrogen combustion systems.


# Fundamental Research in Equivalence Ratio Fluctuations

## Introduction:
Both velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations play a critical role in unsteady heat release, which can trigger thermoacoustic instability. This form of instability arises from the two-way coupling between acoustic waves and unsteady heat release, leading to large-amplitude pressure oscillations and, in severe cases, catastrophic hardware failure. However, isolated influence between velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations on flame dynamics is difficult to distinguish, as velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuation are inherently coupled. To address this challenge, it is essential to investigate flame behavior under well-controlled equivalence ratio perturbations. Such studies not only clarify how flames respond to these fluctuations but also provide valuable insights into the nonlinear dynamics governing combustion stability.
