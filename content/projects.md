      title: Thermoacoustic Instabilities in Clean Combustion Systems
      text: Hydrogen, recognized as a promising alternative decarbonized fuel, has received considerable attention. However, the shift from natural gas to hydrogen in modern well-established gas turbines, which rely on lean premixed combustion to reduce NOx emissions, increases the risk of flashback, potentially causing catastrophic damage to the structure. This necessitates alternative strategies to enable safe and stable hydrogen combustion. The micro-mix concept has recently gained renewed attention for the burning of pure hydrogen. Instead of achieving a fully premixed fuel-air mixture far upstream of the flame, this strategy involves injecting fuel near the exit of the burner, allowing for rapid mixing with the incoming air flow. However, this leads to insufficient mixing and is thus often referred to as a partially premixed (or technically premixed) system since the non-uniformity of the equivalence ratio is still present at the flame.
